# Scraper

This is the link to the [Github] (https://github.com/margosij/Scraper) page!
Here's the link to the Heroku [page!] (https://scraper-app1086.herokuapp.com/)



Some of the technologies used in making this app are:
    1. MongoDB
    2. Heroku
    3. Node
    4. Javascript
    5. gitignore

My role in this project was both writer and designer of the code.

In order to use this app you will need to do the following:
    1. You will need to add the url extension "/scrape" in order to make the app scrap articles.
    2. Once the page says that the scrape is complete, you can go back to the main URL page and it will display the scraped articles.
    3. If you want to make a note on one of the articles, simple click on it and an area will pop up so you can make notes and save them for that particular article.
    4. If you want to see all the articles in a JSON format, simply go to the "/articles" URL extension. This will also show any notes that you saved for a particular article. This will include the ID for whatever note you may have saved to a particular article.
    5. You can see what notes you have in your article my going to the /articles/articleid. the articleid can be found in the /articles url. Example: 5df9894b19b185328c5dc43e
    6. If you would like to update the notes you have, simply click on the article again in the main url page and type in your new note!
